Lockstitch.lib can encrypt and decrypt any kind of files.

public methods/APIs
1. static Lockstitch& getLockstitch()
   This is an static method. When you call a Lockstitch.lib API, you need first call this method Lockstitch point pointing to an instance

2. string encrypt(string);
   Encrypts a string, and returns the encrypted string.  Input is the string which need to be encrypted.
   
3. wstring encrypt(wstring);
      Encrypts a wide string (Unicode string), and returns the encrypted wide string. Input is the wide string which need to be encrypted
      
4. string decrypt(string&);
      Decrypts a string, and returns the decrypted string. Input is the reference of an encrypted string which needs to be decrypted
      
5. wstring decrypt(wstring&);
      Decrypts a wide string, and returns the decrypted wide string. Input is the reference of an encrypted wide string which needs to be decrypted
      
6. string encryptFile(string fileName, bool express = true, int headSize = 0);
      Encrypts the content of a file. It can be any kind of files including text files.
      parameters:
      --- fileName - string type, the name of the file needs to be encrypted
      --- express - bool type, indicates whether fast encryption or multiple ways encryptions
      --- headSize - int type, specify how many starting bytes of the file which you don't want to encrypt. A file starting bytes contains the information of file strcture, format. keep the bytes un-encrypted so that the file still can be open, but may not human readable.
      --- return value - string type.  It is the name of the encrypted file. E.G, input file name is "ABC.bmp", the return value is "ABC_Encode.bmp".
      
7. wstring encryptFile(wstring fileName, bool express = true, int headSize = 0);
      Identicle as previous one, except the input file is type of wstring (wide/Unicode string) instead of string. The return value is also a wstring
      
8. string decryptFile(string fileName, bool express = true);
      Decrypts the content of a encrypted file.
      parameters:
      --- fileName - string type, the name of the file needs to be decrypted
      --- express - bool type, indicates the input file id expressly encrypted or encrypted by multiple encryption ways
      --- return value - string type.  It is the name of the decrypted file. E.G, original file which was decrypted hasing name "ABC.bmp", the return value is "ABC_Decode.bmp".
            
9. wstring decryptFile(wstring fileName, bool express = true);
      Identicle as previous one, except the input file is type of wstring (wide/Unicode string) instead of string. The return value is also a wstring 

10. string loadTxtFile(string& fileName);
      Loads a text file content for encrypting.
      parameters:
      --- fileName -  string type reference. the name of the file.
      return: the encrypted string
      
11. wstring loadTxtFile(wstring&);
      Loads a text file content for encrypting.
      parameters:
      --- fileName -  wstring (wide string/Unicode string) type reference. the name of the file.
      return: the encrypted wide string
